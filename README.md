# Etch-A-Sketch
This project is a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch/sketchpad. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create artwork. The user can hover their cursor across a grid to "draw" something.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## What I learned
### HTML
I only used ID attributes for elements to be changed with JavaScript. All elements that were to be styled had a class attribute.

### CSS
I styled focusable elements to make sure that their style was apparent for disabled users. I also used linear gradients for a specific button element.

### JavaScript
This time around, I believe I did a better job of separating tasks into their own function, no matter how simple or short the task was. I also used named functions for just about the entire script, for better readability and easier debugging. Further, I feel I have a better grasp on changing the DOM. I knew the elements I needed to target, and which functions needed to manipulate them.

## Continuing My Learning
I am still learning how to use words to clearly describe what elements are and what functions do.

## What's New?
### HTML
I added a fill tool that sets the color of every square in the grid. Also, the pencil tool doesn't contain the color input.

### CSS
I tried to use the BEM method for naming classes (I like it). Also, the page design is different.

### JS
The user can click the grid instead of hovering over it to draw. I think this grants the user more control over what they draw.
